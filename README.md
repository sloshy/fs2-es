This is a small library to encode event-sourcing patterns using FS2, a streaming library in Scala.
The library is polymorphic using Cats Effect, so you can use it with any effect type you want that implements `cats.effect.Concurrent`.

To use, add the library to your `build.sbt` like so:
```
libraryDependencies += "dev.rpeters" %% "fs2-es" % "<latest-version>"
libraryDependencies += "dev.rpeters" %% "fs2-es-testing" % "<latest-version>" //Test module
```

Currently Scala 2.12 and 2.13 are both supported. Project is built for Scala JVM and ScalaJS 1.4+.

## Features
This library has three core focuses:

* [State Management](https://sloshy.github.io/fs2-es/docs/eventstate/) - Use "EventState" to model event-driven state that is safe, concurrent, and with no boilerplate.
* [Event Sourcing](https://sloshy.github.io/fs2-es/docs/eventstatecache/) - Manage entities using event sourcing patterns with "EventStateCache", a standard repository interface.
* [Test Utilities](https://sloshy.github.io/fs2-es/docs/testing/) - Utilize time-travel debugging features and other goodies to analyze your state as it changes.
